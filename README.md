# Introduction
This repository contains the course project for the Game Development course at VIA University College. 

# Concept
The game is all about movement and the most satisfying movement mechanic (in my opinion) - Rocket Jumping.
Get through all the maps using the least amount of rockets in the fastest time possible.

# References
## Disclaimer
Most sounds, 3d models (except player model and player cosmetics), particles, textures and shaders are third-party assets.

Maps are orignal has been modelled using ProBuilder inspired by iconic TF2 Rocket Jumping maps.

Animations are assumed to be third-party as well unless it is follows the naming convention: 'original_<SOMETHING>'

Code based on existing implementations has either been referenced directly in the code or below as a reference.
